# ES6 Experimentation

The official ES5 Specification http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf

Support across browsers and platforms: http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/

ES4 previously tried to add to and enhance Javascript features but it was abandoned.

ES6 (started with codename : Harmony) is the biggest change to Javascript in over a decade.

## Variables and Parameters

'let' is the new 'var'

## Classes

Classes are now available in the Javascript syntax. Prototypes are no longer needed.

## Functional Javascript

Shorthand syntax for declaring functions and returning values

## Built in objects

There are brand new built in objects for Javascript e.g. Map

## Asynchronous Javscript

Promises like the ones supported by Angular are to be made part of ES6.

## Modules in Javascript

A module system has not been previously supported. Many libaries have been written to support this functionality in Javascript but ES6 aims to support this logic out of the box.

## Tools

In order to support ES6 on older platforms there are tools called 'transpilers' which compile your ES6 into ES5.

Babel: To transpile ES6 into ES5 for static builds
Babelify: To incorporate babel into your Gulp, Grunt, or npm run build process
Traceur compiler: ES6 features > ES5. Includes classes, generators, promises, destructuring patterns, default parameters & more.
es6ify: Traceur compiler wrapped as a Browserify v2 transform
